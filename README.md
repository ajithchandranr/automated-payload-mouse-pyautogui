# Payload that moves the mouse cursor

This project demonstrates an automated payload using Python and Tkinter. It showcases how to perform mouse movements and open web links automatically.

## Description

The script utilizes the `pyautogui` library to perform mouse movements on the screen. It calculates the target positions based on the screen size and executes a series of movements in a pattern. After the mouse movements, it automatically opens the LinkedIn and GitHub profiles using the `webbrowser` module.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Tkinter - Graphical User Interface (GUI) package for Python.
- pyautogui - Library for programmatically controlling the mouse and keyboard.

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.6:
   - Visit the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Download and install the appropriate version of Python for your operating system.
   - Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

2. Install Tkinter:
   - **Windows**: Tkinter is typically included with the standard Python installation on Windows. If you don't have it, you can install it using the following steps:
     1. Open a command prompt or PowerShell window.
     2. Run the command `pip install tk`.

   - **Linux**: Open a terminal and enter the following command to install Tkinter:
     ```
     sudo apt-get install python3-tk
     ```

   - **macOS**: Tkinter is typically included with the macOS system Python installation.

3. Install pyautogui:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to install pyautogui:
     ```
     pip install pyautogui
     ```

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed.

2. Run the script using the following command:
   ```
   python script.py
   ```

3. A Tkinter window will appear with the following message:
   ```
   This is a demonstration of an automated payload.
   Upon completion, you will be automatically redirected to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
   Thank you for your attention!
   ```

4. After a few seconds, the payload will be executed, and the mouse movements will be performed.

5. The script will automatically open the LinkedIn profile in a new browser tab. You can access it [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajithchandranr/).

6. Similarly, the GitHub profile will also be automatically opened in a new browser tab. You can access it [here](https://github.com/ajithchandranr).

7. The Tkinter window will be closed automatically after a delay.
